<h2> BearMaps </h2>

Implemented the back-end features for a web mapping application such as Map Rastering & Routing. In addition, I implemented the algorithm and data structure to find the shortest route between two locations (A* search algorithm), turn-by-turn directions, map dragging/zooming, search autocomplete, and location search inspired by Google Maps.
